<p>With this number, the <span class="smcap">American Missionary</span> passes into the hands of Rev.
C. C. Painter, as Editor and Business Manager. Mr. Painter was born in the
South, educated at the North, where he was for several years a pastor, and more
recently a Professor of Theology in Fisk University, and connected with its
financial management. He brings to the work a ripe scholarship, the pen of a
ready writer, and a deep interest in the varied work in which the Association is
engaged.</p>

<p>The retirement of the Rev. Geo. M. Boynton, who, for several years, has acted
as Editor of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>, is felt to be a great loss to the Association. His
peculiar skill in editing, his facility in writing, and his quick apprehension of
current events bearing on our work, enabled him to give to our magazine a freshness
and attractiveness it never before had attained. Mr. Boynton’s usefulness as
a member of our Executive Committee makes his loss to us the greater. In
his new pastorate in Jamaica Plain, Boston, he bears with him the warmest
affection and best wishes of the officers of the Association.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As we make our bow after the above graceful introduction by our honored
Senior Secretary, we are conscious that all eyes are turned regretfully toward the
departing, rather than hopefully to the incoming, Editor. We are in the position
similar to that of a new minister, who is told as he makes his first pastoral
visits, “We never expect to love another pastor as we loved Mr. B.” We are
glad for all that makes our position difficult, and suggest as the only remedy for
the loss the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> must otherwise sustain in the retirement of Mr. Boynton,
that all who feel it, shall make the appropriate effort to prevent it. Let our
teachers and missionaries understand, that they must come to the rescue by
prompt and faithful reports of every phase of their work; giving us rich material
from which to select what, from our stand-point, appears <i>the</i> thing to be said
at any given time. Let Pastors and Superintendents, and other co-laborers, feel
that they must stand between this work and loss, and double their diligence,
and quicken their zeal, in keeping their churches and schools informed and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
interested; and, finally, let all who have felt an impulse to <i>give</i> more, show their
appreciation of the late Editor’s good work by such an increase of gifts, as shall
meet the urgent demands on our Treasury; and in <i>reporting</i> all this, we promise
the most interesting numbers of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> yet published. Thus:</p>

<p>We have received a copy of the new map of Central and Southern Africa,
published by the A. B. C. F. M. As an outline map for chapel purposes, we believe
it unsurpassed in beauty and cheapness. The price, on paper, is 75c.; on
cloth, $1.25; to be had of C. N. Chapin, 14 Congregational House, Boston.</p>

<p>Dr. T. Thornton Macklin, who for several years was connected with the Blantyre
Mission in the region of the Nyassa, is making a brief visit to this country,
and gave us much valuable information about methods of work in Equatorial
Africa, in an hour’s interview at our office. Dr. Macklin is anxious to return to
Africa and enter upon pioneer work, such as that proposed by Mr. Arthington to
the A. M. A., in the Nile basin.</p>

<p>We are glad to know that Dr. G. B. Willcox, whose presence and counsels
are sadly missed in our Committee meetings, loses none of his enthusiasm for the
American Missionary Association and its work, because of his new home and new
duties. At a recent meeting in Dr. Noble’s church in Chicago, he read an address
which we wish could be put into the hands of every Christian, and of every
citizen, in the land. It is too long to print in our pages, and too consecutive to dismember
without marring. We hope he may have calls to deliver it before the
other churches of that city, and of other cities, East and West.</p>

<p><img class="table" src="images/i_decrule2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We fear that a fact, stated by Mrs. Hill in our last number, has not been fully
taken in by our readers. Writing from Marion, Ala., of her work among the
children, she said, incidentally, and most of us read it without comprehending it,
“The girls’ sewing-class has sent $38 to the Mendi Mission.”</p>

<p>The “<span class="smcap">Girls’ Sewing-Class</span>!” “<span class="smcap">Thirty-eight Dollars!</span>” Sunday-school
workers of New England, think what that means! We venture to say there is
scarce a Sunday-school connected with one of our churches in New England
where the same amount of money would cost a girls’ sewing-class one-half the
self-denial and labor that is represented by this $38 for the Mendi Mission. And
it came from a colored girls’ sewing-class!</p>

<p><img class="table" src="images/i_decrule2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some time since, a request came from a teacher in one of our institutions to the
Sunday-school of the Second Congregational Church in Rockville, Conn., that it
should raise $70 for a promising young man who, for lack of it, must leave his
studies. The matter was brought before the school and laid over for consideration.
On the next Sabbath, a class of young men, every one of whom was earning his own
living, stated that it would assume the responsibility for the whole amount. To
raise this money did not hurt them; on the contrary, it did them as much good
as it did the one who received it. What if this same spirit should become
epidemic in our schools!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p>The Sunday-school at Kenosha, Wis., when its pastor read to it President
Cravath’s article in the October <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>, entitled “What shall we do?”
promptly responded by sending a check for $50. Pastors, Sunday-school superintendents
and teachers, it is not a difficult thing to do, but a most easy, and
as blessed as easy, to enlist your young people in this beneficent work; beneficent
not alone in relation to the ignorant negroes, but to your own young people.
The needs of our work are great, but the need that our Sunday-school children
and young people be educated out of narrow, selfish views of life, is even
more urgent. Let this double education go forward steadily and by organized
effort; thus shall sower and reaper rejoice together, and it will be difficult to tell
the one from the other in their mutual joy and benefit, for both are reapers of
such sowing.</p>

<p><img class="table" src="images/i_decrule2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Selma, Ala., <i>Daily Times</i> notes the fact that our Field Secretary, Dr.
Roy, preached in the First Presbyterian Church of that city in the morning, and
the Rev. H. S. DeForest in the evening, of a recent Sabbath, and says that more
than usual interest was manifested in both services. Also, in a kindly notice of
the Fifth Annual Convention of the Congregational Churches of Alabama, convened
in that city, it says: “This church is doing a great work for the education and religious
culture of the colored people in Alabama, and the other Southern States.”</p>

<p>Dr. R. S. Rust, Secretary of the M. E. Freedmen’s Aid Society, in his Twelfth
Annual Report of the work of that Society, speaks with a just pride of the twenty
distinctive colored schools established in the South, with an aggregate of 2,510
pupils: of these, 453 are classed as Biblical, 20 law, 60 medical, 74 collegiate,
270 academic, 1,020 normal, 242 intermediate, and 371 primary.</p>

<p>We congratulate him and his church on the good work done, and to be done.</p>

<p><img class="table" src="images/i_decrule2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Prof. J. W. Randolph, of Waco College, Texas, which, we understand, is a
newly-projected school, to be under management of the colored people, announces
his purpose of publishing a new music and hymn-book for and by his own people;
and so the genius of this people is reaching out into new fields of effort.</p>

<p>Facts are facts <i>positeevely</i>, as Dr. John Brown’s Scotch beadle would say, and
will assert and establish themselves if we can only have patience in well-doing.
The professor of Greek in one of the State Colleges of the South said to us, some
months since: “I spent a day in Fisk University, and as I am, and have been all
my life, a teacher of Greek, was curious to see what the negro could do with that
language; and, sir, I should be most proud and happy if I had twenty boys in
my College who could recite Greek as I heard that number of boys and girls
reciting it in that school.”</p>

<p>The teacher of these boys and girls was a young colored woman, 22 years of
age, herself a graduate of the school in which she was then teaching.</p>

<p><img class="table" src="images/i_decrule2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Among the many indications of the growing interest taken by the best class
of Southern people in the educational work of our schools, we note the frequent
kindly notices, given in the daily papers of the cities in which our schools are located,
of anything that concerns the work. We clip the following from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
<i>Morning Ledger</i>, of Memphis, in appreciative mention of the lecture course before
Le Moyne Institute of that city: “It is an encouraging sign of the times
when such men as Dr. Maury, Judge Morgan, Col. Eaton, and Judge Hammond
give their time and talents for the instruction and elevation of the colored race,
especially when these people show a disposition and a capacity for moral and intellectual
improvement. It is an indisputable evidence of the amiable relations
of the two races, and gives assurance that the traces of the war, and its bad passions,
are wearing out, and that we have entered upon a peaceful, law-abiding era,
with a good basis for solid prosperity.”</p>

<p>At the close of the last lecture, delivered by Rev. Mr. Trible, Col. L. B. Eaton
arose, and after reference to the success of the course and its good results
to the community, proposed, as appreciative of the lecture and expressive of their
interest in the object, that they should take a collection, which resulted in over
$30 for the library of the school.</p>

<p>We learn that these lectures have been prepared with the same care as if intended
for the most cultivated white audiences, and without condescension or patronage,
were delivered as if addressed to an audience of young men and women without
any hint, direct or implied, of race, color, or previous condition.</p>

<h3 id="Gen_Grants_Reception_at_Straight_University">GEN. GRANT’S RECEPTION AT STRAIGHT UNIVERSITY.</h3>

<p>Just as the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> was going to press, we received a letter from Dr.
Roy, who is now in New Orleans, giving a brief sketch of the visit of Gen. Grant
to the Straight University. We have also a more full account in the <i>New Orleans
Times</i>, but we can offer our readers in this number only the shorter narrative.
Dr. Roy writes:</p>

<p>“We gave a reception to Gen. Grant in the chapel. Flags were displayed at the
front and behind the platform, with the big map on the wall and a placard ‘Our
Country.’ The school and the patrons filled the hall. Prof. McPherron led his
scholars in some exquisite classic music; Prof. Alexander made the welcoming
address in behalf of the Straight University. Gen. Grant responded in one of
his laconic and fitting speeches, which was greatly satisfactory to the colored
people. Gen. Grant said:</p>

<p>“‘It is a good sign to see such a University as this attended by colored people
who were for so long deprived of any such advantage. Those who have gone
before you had no such advantages. But by the gift of these institutions, those
here are taking the first great step towards improving the advantages guaranteed
to them by the Constitution. Great advantages are given these people by the
provisions of the Constitution and the Amendments, and the colored people are
coming to improve them. The privilege of emigration is permitted and allowed
to any people. But other things being equal, every one is happiest in passing his
life in the locality where he was born. So that I am glad to see you improving
these opportunities. I hope everything for the colored people, and may you make
freedom a blessing to yourselves. Gentlemen, I thank you for your kindness.’</p>

<p>“Then the Field Supt., in behalf of the A. M. A., followed, thanking the General
for the peace-policy which he had inaugurated, and which is affording so
much aid to our work among the Indians; and thanking him for his word in
China, upon Chinese emigration, which has helped us in our missions on the
Pacific coast. The Superintendent also reported the extent of the work of the A.
M. A. at the South, the patriotism of the colored people, and their hunger for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
knowledge. A young lady, in behalf of the students, presented the General with
a bouquet, and Col. Lewis (colored), Collector of the Port, responded for the
colored soldiers of Port Hudson. The scholars and friends then filed around
and shook hands with the General.”</p>

<h3 id="Old_Nails_Well_Clinched">OLD NAILS WELL CLINCHED.</h3>

<p>Three cases of more than ordinary importance were decided in the United States
Supreme Court, last month, from which it happily appears that the soul of Judge
Taney doesn’t “go marching on.” The Negro has rights. Thanks to the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution, he has exactly the same civil rights as the
white citizen. Moreover, he has equal rights before the courts&mdash;any “State
Sovereignty” legislation discriminating against him to the contrary notwithstanding.
The test-cases, which had been appealed to the Supreme Court, were those in
which colored men had been put on trial for alleged crimes in State courts, and had
been denied the right of having any member of their own race on the jury. This
discrimination against them, on account of race and color, was pronounced
unconstitutional and illegal. The decision is one to awaken devout thankfulness
and patriotic pride in the hearts of all lovers of humanity and equal rights
for all.&mdash;<i>The Advance.</i></p>

<h3 id="The_Case_in_a_Nut_shell">THE CASE IN A NUT-SHELL.</h3>

<p>Judge Tourgee, if he <i>is</i> the author of that remarkable book, “A Fool’s
Errand,” which every citizen of the Union should not only read, but profoundly
study, puts the case in a nut-shell when, in answer to his old teacher’s question,
“But what can be done for their (the Negroes’) elevation and relief, or to prevent
the establishment of a medi&aelig;val barbarism in our midst?” he says:</p>

<p>“The remedy is one that must be applied from the outside. <i>The remedy
for darkness is light; for ignorance, knowledge; for wrong, righteousness.</i> The nation
nourished and protected slavery. The fruitage of slavery has been the ignorant
freedman, the ignorant poor white man, and the arrogant master. Now, let the
nation undo the evil it has permitted and encouraged; let it educate those whom
it made ignorant, and protect those whom it made weak. It is not a matter of
favor to the black, but of safety to the nation. Make the spelling-book the
sceptre of national power. Let the nation educate the colored man and the poor
white man, because the nation held them in bondage, and is responsible for their
education; educate the voter, because the nation cannot afford that he should be
ignorant. Honest ignorance in the masses is more to be dreaded than malevolent
intelligence in the few.”</p>

<p>We express no opinion as to his method for applying this remedy, as it would
lead to a discussion of political questions with which, as such, we have nothing
to do. But that the remedy for, and the provision against, these threatening
evils, is the education of these people, of this there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>We are happy to say, also, that the work already accomplished by our schools
is dissipating the fears, conciliating the prejudices, and disarming the hostility of
the Southern people, who are coming more and more to appreciate and sympathize
with the effort to educate the Negro, and in helpful ways to co-operate with us
in this work. The remedy, indeed, must come from without; but it is beginning
to operate, and the most hopeful symptom of healthful action is that the patient
begins to appreciate and demand it.

<h3 id="Southern_Negroes_in_New_York_City">SOUTHERN NEGROES IN NEW YORK CITY.</h3>

<p>In our efforts to find out the needs of the emigrants for Liberia, now in New
York, we have discovered facts in regard to the resident colored population
in the city which were to us a great surprise. One of its most intelligent
colored men informs us that of the 20,000 colored inhabitants in this city,
only about 5,000 are of Northern birth.</p>

<p>A church organized two years ago, with 21 members, has now a membership
of 150, and a congregation of about 800, all of whom are from the South. They
now worship in a hall for which they pay $40 per month; have raised more than
$3,000 for current expenses; $300 for charities, and have $2,000 in bank toward
a church building. The pastor of this church is a young ex-slave from Norfolk,
Virginia.</p>

<p>Now, in regard to the refugees themselves, we believe an attendance upon the
meeting in Dr. Garnet’s church, called to organize and systematize the effort to
care for them, would have proved a radical cure for chronic and most persistent
doubt as to the negroes’ ability to meet an emergency. The overflowing charity
of that meeting was only matched by the wisdom, prudence and skill with which
it was managed.</p>

<p>If the Christian churches and friends of Christ would but seek out, and bring
as prominently before the public, facts, of which there are many, such as the
above, showing the rapid progress these people are making under great discouragements,
as the police courts and enemies of the negro report and dwell upon
those which show his degradation, we are confident he would be held in much
higher estimation.</p>

<p>We venture to say that a like number of refugees of any other race, in as great
destitution, with a similar story of wrongs, whether true or false, could not be
so quietly stowed away in New York, or left to be cared for so exclusively by
their own people. There have been no urgent appeals to the public, and either
none at all, or but a passing notice of their arrival, in our religious papers.</p>

<h3 id="Womans_Home_Missionary_Association">WOMAN’S HOME MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<p>This new organization held its first public meeting in Boston, March 18th.
The ladies assembled at eleven o’clock in the lecture room of the Park Street
Church, which was crowded. Mrs. C. A. Richardson, of Chelsea, presided; Mrs.
J. F. Hunnewell, of Charlestown, acted as Secretary. By-laws were read and
adopted. An address on the general subject was made by Mrs. Sarah K. Bolton;
and Mrs. Steele, of Revere, gave a very interesting account of her labors in Maryland
for eight years among the poor whites.</p>

<p>A more public meeting was held in the afternoon in the audience-room of the
church, which was also well filled. Rev. Dr. Webb presided, and made a very appropriate
and encouraging introductory address, sketching the new range of work
opened for women in the missionary world, and assuring the new organization of the
welcome it would receive by the officers and friends of the American Board and
the Woman’s Board. By invitation, representatives of the American Missionary
Association and of the American Home Missionary Society addressed the audience;
Rev. C. L. Woodworth and Rev. M. E. Strieby, D. D., appearing for the former,
and Rev. Robert West and Rev. H. M. Storrs, D. D., for the latter. These gentlemen
confined themselves, as was expected, to presenting a view of the wide
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
fields occupied by their respective societies, and the great need and remarkable
hopefulness which they furnished for the labor of woman in the elevation and
Christianization of the more destitute women and children of the great West and
South.</p>

<p>This new organization originated entirely with the ladies themselves, and, as
far as we can judge, has been inaugurated and will be carried forward with great
wisdom and efficiency, and with no spirit of rivalry, but with the utmost Christian
consideration and love towards other similar boards. It is hard to predict the
future of a new benevolent organization. Who could have conjectured in 1810
the grand reach of Christian labor achieved by the ever-to-be-honored American
Board? And who, ten years ago, could have foreseen the remarkable energy and
wonderful success&mdash;then latent, but now active&mdash;displayed by the Christian
women of this land in the several denominations in co-operation with the great
Missionary Boards? But while we cannot prophesy of the future of this new
society, yet the success of those we have mentioned encourages us to anticipate
for it a glorious career. There certainly is room in this our land, among the
women and children of less favored portions and races, for the widest and most
hopeful endeavors that can be put forth; and while the degraded of distant lands
should not be neglected, certainly those in our own should not be passed by.
This new Board has our warmest sympathies.</p>

<h3 id="EASTERN_NORTH_CAROLINA">EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA.</h3>

<p>In a letter from Rev. J. Edwards, of Grantville, Mass., he adds his testimony
to the many that reach us from all directions, that the South is experiencing a
gradual, and to one who visits it after several years’ absence, marked uplifting.
He also comes back full of the assurance, as do all others who study the “problem
of the South,” that the A. M. A. is doing good work just where it is needed.
We thank him for his letter, and second his suggestion that our work presents
a magnificent opportunity to the Christian and patriot. We have room for a few
extracts:</p>

<p>“Enter the train of the Seaboard &amp; Roanoke Railroad and you will be carried
very comfortably through a country as monotonous and unexciting as you will
often find. You can bear to watch, for once, the scenery that looks so painfully
uninviting it is positively entertaining: light land, scattered pines, and here
and there, the so-called villages, of which you might say, ‘enough of them&mdash;such
as they are.’ No bright green sward; and as for houses, homes&mdash;where are
they? Surely not very near the line of the railroad, unless you can by courtesy
give the name to the scanty cabins, with the tow-headed children, and the wan
women, and the man scratching the top of the earth with a plow drawn by one
decrepit steer or sorry mule.</p>

<p>“The railroad on to which you pass at Weldon, would carry you to Wilmington,
famed throughout the old North State for its delightful social life. But we stop
one hundred miles short of this, in the heart of the State. Your desolate ride
has hardly prepared you for the pleasing aspect of the town that greets you.
Comfortable houses, some of them tasteful, with abundant flower-yards, and,
now and then, the familiar green turf, preserved with a good deal of pains; the
county buildings, numerous and large stores, some of them doing a business of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
two or three hundred thousand a year, assure you that here, too, are homes and
American enterprise. You are in the midst of the cotton belt&mdash;a dry, light, almost
sandy soil, level like the bottom of a lake, showing signs (in beds of marl, with
shells not yet absorbed) of having been once under the sea, easily tilled; large
amounts of chemical fertilizers in use; plenty of work for both whites and blacks;
and, although some of both races are do-nothings, numbers of both are industrious
and reap the reward. The relations between the two races here appear to
the casual eye entirely peaceful. Some blacks are leaving for Indiana, and a
few are returning; and the departure of those who go from this particular section
only gives more room and occupation for those who stay.</p>

<p>“A fragment of the conversation of two negroes I overheard on the street
sounded true and sensible: ‘My ’pinion is, one dat’s willin’ to work, kin make a
livin’ most anywhar; as fur &mdash;&mdash; he allus was too lazy to live; he’s too lazy to
die. I don’t b’lieve nuffin sech as he ses.’ They were talking of a bright but indolent
mulatto, well known in the place, who had lately exodusized and come back.</p>

<p>“The churches are Baptist, Episcopal, and Methodist, with ‘Hard-shells,’
Campbellites, etc. The colored people have churches and preachers of their own,
and will never rise very high till they have schools and better churches.</p>

<p>“The lack of schools is a great evil, felt and deplored by some of the best
people. There are private schools for the whites who can pay for them, but no
public schools for them, and none of any kind for the blacks here yet. But times
move forward and grow better.”</p>

<small>Training Nurses&mdash;Needle-Work&mdash;Preparation of Food, etc.</small></h3>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> for March, 1879, Miss Milton gave some account of the industrial
department of the school at Le Moyne, and also announced the purpose
of giving attention to the training of nurses.</p>

<p>Prof. Steele writes that their plans have been more fully developed with most
gratifying results. During the year, about an hour each day has been devoted to
such work, without interfering with regular studies, and with the effect of stimulating
the students in all other directions. The list of questions on the care of
the sick, which constituted a part of their examination at the close of the winter
term, indicates a varied and minute training, which must fit these pupils to be
angels of mercy, and most blessed ministers of comfort and health in many cabins
of the South.</p>

<p>Professor Steele reports a death-rate among the negroes of Memphis that is
simply appalling. He says in other cities of the South it is about double that
among the whites; in Memphis it is three times as great. We are confident that
this disproportion does not prevail through the country. The blacks are gregarious,
and crowding into the cities, as they do, in ignorance and poverty, disease
is fearfully fatal among the children; but we do not believe the forthcoming
census will establish such a death-rate as the above among the colored population
at large.</p>

<p>Our teachers, wise and Christ-like in their spirit, are directing their efforts to
whatever affects the welfare of these poor people, and their condition will constantly
improve.

<h3 id="ANGLO_TURKISH_CONVENTION_FOR_THE_SUPPRESSION_OF_THE_SLAVE_TRADE">ANGLO-TURKISH CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE
SLAVE-TRADE.</h3>

<p>The Queen of England announced at the opening of the last session of Parliament,
Feb. 5th, “That a convention for the suppression of the slave-trade has
been concluded between my Government and that of his Imperial Majesty the
Sultan.” This was very gratifying to all who had so long waited the signing of
the oft-promised and oft-delayed treaty with Turkey. On the 9th of February, it
was said by the Under-Secretary of State that the treaty had been signed but not
ratified, and would soon be laid upon the table of the House of Commons. In the
meantime, what purports to be a copy of the treaty has been published.</p>

<p>An examination of its several articles creates grave fears that astute Turkish
diplomacy has been too much for Sir Henry Layard in this matter. It is all very
well for English cruisers to have the right to search suspected ships, sailing under
the Turkish flag, for slaves; but their officers cannot touch African <i>slave</i> seamen,
and it will be easy to so make out a ship’s papers that she can carry many more
men than she needs, and she can change her crew every voyage. All slaves
seized, another article provides, shall be turned over to <i>Ottoman authorities for the
purpose of proclaiming them free</i>, which, we fear, will prove as effectual in accomplishing
that result, as throwing the turtle into the water by the simpleton
was effectual in drowning it.</p>

<p>When England made treaties with other slave-holding nations for the suppression
of the slave-trade, she provided that captured slaves should be tried before a
mixed Commission in which British officers sat. In this treaty they take their
chances for freedom before an Ottoman Court.</p>

<p>In this connection we regret to announce that Pacha Gordon has resigned, and
his resignation has been accepted; and thus Central Africa loses its noble
Christian ruler. He went out in 1874 as Governor General of Soudan, “to establish
a regular government, to create facilities for commerce, and to destroy the
slave-trade in the province entrusted to him,” and his resignation will bring dismay
to all who have the cause of humanity at heart. It was at first
reported that Ismail Eyoub Pacha had been appointed to take his place, who,
while not Gordon Pacha, was, it is said, as good a man for the post as could be
found in Egypt. But the <i>Anti-Slavery Reporter</i> now says, “it is officially announced
that the actual successor is one Raouf Bey, of evil memory.”</p>

<p>This Raouf Bey is spoken of by Sir Samuel Baker in his “Ismailia” as the bosom
friend of Abou Saood, whom he describes “as the <i>incarnation of the slave-trade</i>, and
the greatest slave-dealer on the White Nile.” Colonel Gordon thinks it certain
that the slave-dealers will at once resume their operations, and will be unmolested
by the new Governor. He estimates that at least 30,000 slaves have annually, for
the past twelve years, been brought down from the Bahr Gazelle and Darfur; and
Vice-Consul Wylde believes that not less than 50,000 annually cross the Red Sea,
who are taken to Egypt, Turkey, and other Mohammedan countries. And now, it
seems, the Anglo-Turkish Convention provides that slaves captured by the English
shall be handed over to the <i>Ottoman</i> authorities to be by them declared free, and a
noted slave-hunter displaces the Christian suppressor of that hellish traffic in the
governorship of the slave-hunting grounds.

<h3 id="H_M_Stanley_on_the_Congo">MR. H. M. STANLEY ON THE CONGO.<br />

<small>[From the Field, March 12.]</small></h3>

<p>As the recent movements of this well known African explorer have not been
given in detail, the following translation of a letter written by Father Carrie,
head of the Congo Mission, dated Landana, December 3, 1879, and published in
<i>Les Missions Catholiques</i> (No. 559), may not be without interest.</p>

<p>Father Carrie says: “Having just returned from a voyage through the whole
navigable portion of the Lower Congo, I take the first opportunity of sending you
the following particulars concerning Mr. Stanley and his explorations. The party
of the great explorer is somewhat numerous. It consists, besides the leader, of a
superintendent, an engineer, a sea captain, several mechanics, carpenters, etc., in
all, twenty whites of different nationalities&mdash;Belgians, Americans, English, Italians,
and Danes. A French naturalist, M. Protche, just come to Landana from Paris,
and an old member of the German expedition to Chinchoxo, near Landana, are
also about to join The ‘Society for the Investigation of the Upper Congo,’ as this
expedition terms itself.</p>

<p>“The blacks of the party consist of about one hundred men, Arabs and natives
from Sierra Leone and the Congo. The stores are very considerable, comprising
especially five small steamers and some auxiliary craft, engines and trucks for
land carriage, wooden houses ready for erection, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stanley, as I am informed by Mr. Greshoff, proposes to go up the Congo
to the Lualaba, where he hopes to meet his Arab friend Tibu-tin. He will then
explore the Western part of the Congo as well as the countries near both of its
banks, and will endeavor at the same time to bring the ivory-trade to Emboma.
When we arrived at Vivi (four or five miles below the first cataract of the Yellala
Falls), Mr. Stanley was on his way across the mountains in the direction of the
great village of the same name, doubtless studying the start for his route to the
interior. M. Van Schandel, chief engineer of the expedition, told us that the
celebrated traveller habitually started on such excursions without warning any
one of his going or returning. Soon, however, Mr. Stanley himself was announced;
he returned tired to death and covered with dust and perspiration.</p>

<p>“While waiting for the end of the rainy season, he is engaged in firmly establishing
his first station&mdash;the base of all his future operations&mdash;and in maturing his
plans for overcoming the gigantic difficulties in his way.</p>

<p>“It is, indeed, a startling enterprise to traverse some two hundred miles of
precipitous, rocky mountains, piled up&mdash;so to speak&mdash;one on the other, and
almost without any intermediate passage, not only with a numerous party, but a
considerable weight of baggage, wooden houses, trucks and steam vessels, which
must be hoisted over heights of from 1,000 to 1,300 feet, with extremely abrupt
rises; and this not once, or twenty, or a hundred times, but on thousands of
occasions.</p>

<p>“Happen what may, it will require some years’ work to reach the end of this
terrible chain of mountains at Stanley Pool, where the second station is to be
established.”</p>

<p>Making every allowance for the fears of the worthy ecclesiastic whose letter
we have here given, it is sufficiently evident that Mr. Stanley has his work cut out
in executing the Belgian international programme. He will, apparently, have a
land journey of three hundred miles before he can make use of the river, and he
himself considers that it will take three years to carry out the project successfully.

<h3 id="Jesus_sat_over_against_the_Treasury">JESUS SAT OVER AGAINST THE TREASURY!</h3>

<p>It is an assurance full of sweet comfort, especially to the poor, that One sits
over against the treasury who estimates at its full value the widow’s mite, knowing
as He does out of what love and self-denial it comes. With a check for the
last instalment of $100 from the estate of a poor widow, comes a brief sketch
of a life that was beautiful and touching; a life that was full of struggle,
and sorrow, and benefaction; which closed in blindness after 88 years. After a
brief married life, she was left a widow with one child, in great poverty. She
won a home with her needle, in which she lived for forty-two years, the last
twenty-six of these entirely alone, as her daughter had been taken from her by
death.</p>

<p>She lived her brave, self-forgetful, helpful life; active in all good words and
works in church and neighborhood, economizing where her own wants were concerned,
keeping guard even over the use of matches; liberal to the limit, not
only of what she <i>had</i>, but of what she <i>could earn</i>, where the needs of others were
known. Intelligently acquainted with the work of the Church, at home and abroad,
from a wide reading of all our home and foreign missionary journals, she accepted
it as the highest duty and most honored privilege of life to fill up, according to
her measure in her own body, what remains behind of the sufferings of the divine
Redeemer. Such gifts are as precious ointment poured upon the head of the
Master, and He accepts them with the pledge that they shall not be lost. It were
almost a sacrilege to write a name upon our pages by way of eulogy which the
Master himself has pronounced with honor before His angels: “Thou hast been
faithful over a very little.” “Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.”</p>

<p>And He still sits over against the treasury, noting not alone the widow’s mite,
but the larger gifts of those who give, if not abundantly, yet out, of their
abundance.</p>

<h3 id="Gradations_Natural_and_Helpful">GRADATIONS, NATURAL AND HELPFUL.</h3>

<p>Can civilization reach the state of nature, that state which God meant for it,
until men know how to divide society equally, from top to bottom? I do not
mean by this that there will ever come a time when two will not be more than
one, when four will not be more than two, and when eight will not be more than
four; I do not mean that we shall ever see the time when there will not be gradations
in society from the top to the bottom&mdash;gradations of power, gradations of
intelligence, gradations of wealth, gradations of refinement; but there is to be in
society just that which exists in households&mdash;namely, a disposition, that runs
from the top to the bottom, of love and sympathy; and when you have so
stratified society, and organized it, and made every member of it, from the
lowest to the highest, feel, “My brother above me is pulling me up higher,”
we shall begin to realize our true relation, and fulfil our appointed duty one
to another. When in society it is as it is on the sides of mountains, where
men, being helped by those who are above them, turn round and help those who
are below them, and go on a few steps and again are helped by those that are
above them, and again help those that are below them, and so on until they reach
the top, then gradation will not be an evil. Gradation is now an evil because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
there is a stratum of prosperity, and a thick slice of selfishness; then another
stratum of prosperity, and a thicker slice of selfishness; and so on, selfishness growing
thicker and thicker as you go toward the bottom. It has got to be broken
up. The low places, the valleys, have got to be exalted, the mountains have got
to be brought down, and men have got to mix and coalesce. In other words, the
day has got to come when that simple sentence, a million times repeated, and a
million times not understood, shall be fulfilled, and love to God and love to man
shall be the law of the universe, and of universal conditions. We have got to
come to it first or last.&mdash;<i>Christian Union.</i></p>

<span id="Lincoln_Mission" class="medium">Lincoln Mission.</span><br />

<small>REV. SIMON P. SMITH, <span id="Washington">WASHINGTON.</span></small></h3>

<p>A great deal has been said recently
about the Lincoln Mission in the District
of Columbia, and probably many would
like to hear how the work is progressing.</p>

<p>There is a very large Sunday-school
at this mission, and has been for several
years. The teachers come from Dr.
Rankin’s church, more than fifty of
them, and manifest great enthusiasm.
The school averages about three hundred
scholars, and on some occasions,
during the cold weather, we had more
than four hundred.</p>

<p>The majority of these children come
from the poorest and most illiterate colored
families in the city. They have
good training in the day-schools, but
bad home influences. Their parents do
not bring them up as they should, hence
they are very rude. There is much need
of a lady missionary here to teach the
mothers of these children how to make
homes happy.</p>

<p>It is said that there are about sixty
thousand colored people in the city, and
from the appearance of loiterers standing
on the streets, there must be twenty
thousand out of employment. Idleness
is the mother of mischief, and what an
opportunity such people have to enter
into temptation! Some of the parents
of the children who come to the Lincoln
Mission are among these idlers.</p>

<p>These children are very poorly
dressed; they scarcely have sufficient
clothing to keep them warm. We hold
prayer-meeting with them every Wednesday
evening, and we find it very
difficult to keep them away from the
stove. This seems to indicate that they
have but little fire at home. We are
always glad to have it cold on Wednesday
evenings, for, then, we are sure of
a good audience; and we can tell them
about the words of eternal life. Many
desire to be prayed for, and we believe
that some of them love the Lord
Jesus.</p>

<p>General O. O. Howard was with us
recently, and addressed the children.
While he was speaking, his words were
so full of sympathy and love that he
held the attention of the rudest class of
boys in the city for more than an hour.
The sheep know the shepherd’s voice&mdash;even
the lambs. We know that he
loves our nation, because he built us
this synagogue, and we love him
because he loves us. He is, indeed, a
true philanthropist.</p>

<h3 id="NORTH_CAROLINA">NORTH CAROLINA.</h3>

<h4 id="Wilmington">Wilmington.</h4>

<p>In place of a report from our teachers
at this place, we are happy to substitute
a letter from a visitor from the North
who happened to reach Wilmington in
time for the examinations. We have
yet to hear of the first visitor who has
not become an enthusiastic friend of our
work. We do not wish a general decline
in health among our friends, but we do
wish that all visitors to the South would
make themselves acquainted with this
work.</p>

<h4 id="Report_of_a_Visitor">REPORT BY A VISITOR.</h4>

<p>Returning with my friend from our
winter’s stay in Florida, we embraced
the opportunity to stop in Wilmington,
and visit Mr. and Mrs. Dodge, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
see their work among the colored people.
We arrived the day previous to
the exhibition which was to close the
winter’s term of school. Friday evening,
March 26, at 8 o’clock, we repaired
to the pleasant hall of the building,
where were gathered over a hundred
bright, interesting-looking boys and girls
between the ages of five and eighteen,
well and neatly clad, and a fine looking
audience of expectant parents and
friends, who filled the room to its utmost
capacity. The exercises were opened
with singing by the school, one of the
ladies presiding most creditably at the
organ.</p>

<p>Then followed responsive reading
from the Bible, led by Miss Warner, and
a prayer of thankfulness, by Mr. Dodge,
for the possibilities now opened to this
once oppressed race. After devotions
came recitations, declamations, and dialogues,
interspersed with music, in which
all participated, and the exercises from
beginning to end were conducted with
a correctness and order that would have
done credit to any white school in
the North. One of the pleasantest
features of the evening was the representation
of the re-united States, in
which each scholar appeared wearing
upon his or her shoulder the name of
one of the States, and repeating some
appropriate motto or watch-word.
When all were gathered on the platform
the Goddess of Liberty took her place
in the center, waving the stars and
stripes as they sang the “Star-Spangled
Banner.”</p>

<p>I only wish more friends in the North
could have seen in their faces, and heard
from their lips, the pride and gratitude
which these parents are already finding
in the education of their children. Sunday
morning we attended service in the
same hall, where Mr. Dodge conducted
the exercises much as he would those of a
church at home, with singing, responsive
reading, and an exposition of the Scripture
appropriate to Easter. At two o’clock
Miss Farrington, who has this year joined
the Home in the capacity of a
missionary, gathered in one of the lower
rooms for instruction, what she calls her
mission school, made up of those outside
the church. At three, a large Sunday-school
came together in the hall,
and after devotions were assigned to
their respective teachers for work.</p>

<p>Again, in the evening Mr. Dodge presented
Paul and his strivings to a company
of attentive listeners. No one can
realize, who has not been on the ground,
the sacrifice and labors of this little band
of workers, who are so completely isolated
by prejudice from their own people,
and are giving up everything to
the elevation of this unfortunate people.
One of the saddest things about the
work is the lack of means to accommodate
those who would be glad to avail
themselves of the advantages of this
school. If we at the North could only
see how small would be our largest gifts
compared with those of these teachers,
should we not do much more?</p>

<h4 id="Raleigh">Raleigh.</h4>

<p>Reverend George E. Smith sends an
account of the refreshing, and in every
way helpful labors of Reverend Henry
E. Brown, during a few weeks’ visit to
the churches of Raleigh. It will be
remembered that Rev. Mr. Brown was
connected with our work at Talladega,
where, by his devoted and earnest labors,
not only as Pastor and Professor of Theology,
but as a missionary to the regions
about, he established a number of churches
and did much to ensure their success.
He is now in the employ of the colored
Y. M. C. Association of Raleigh, and
is visiting the churches of the South
under its auspices.</p>

<p>He reached Raleigh at noon on the 9th
of February, and with characteristic zeal
had visited every colored pastor of the
city before night, and arranged for a
meeting held that evening in the Congregational
Church, which was crowded to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
overflowing. Three delegates of the
Y. M. C. A., white, were present, and after
hearing Bro. Brown’s plan of operations,
cordially endorsed them, and proffered
their assistance in carrying them out.
Meetings for workers were held in the
afternoon of each day; from this those
who co-operated in the work went out
to prayer-meetings in different parts of
the city, and in the evening general meetings
were held in the various churches.</p>

<p>Bro. Smith adds: There is now a
revival going on in every colored church
in the city, and we really feel that it is a
revival of religion, not mere excitement.</p>

<p>Since Brother Brown came in our
midst, over one hundred souls have been
born into the kingdom of Christ. Many
of the Sunday-school scholars have been
led to reflect, and to accept the Saviour
as their great head and teacher. Brother
Brown’s labors among us have been a
blessing to all. One minister said the
other day, “My people have more religion
than they used to have.” When
asked why he thought so, he replied,
“Because they are living better.”</p>

<p>It may be gratifying to the many
friends of our little church to know that
we have shared in this great blessing.
At our next communion season, which is
the first Sabbath in April, we expect a
glorious time, as ten persons have already
made application to unite with us
at that time. There may be more, as
there are many anxious ones who meet
with us every night inquiring the way of
salvation. Since Brother Brown left, we
have still carried on the meetings.</p>

<p class="hang">A Full and Delightful Meeting&mdash;Abundant
and Most Courteous Hospitality of the Citizens.</p>

<h5>BY MISS A. E. SAWYER.</h5>

<p>The fifth annual meeting of the Alabama
Conference was held, beginning
Saturday evening, March 27th, and closing
on the evening of the 30th, at Selma,
a city noted for wide streets, beautiful
trees, and pleasant homes. Rev. C. B.
Curtis assured us of a hearty welcome
from the church, which had long been
anticipating this meeting, and Rev. O.
W. Fay, of Montgomery, followed with
the opening sermon, upon Christian
activity.</p>

<p>The sermon on Sabbath morning, by
President DeForest, upon the power of
the Gospel, was given in concise, terse
language, and when, at the close, he
pictured the scene at the last day, when
Christ should receive the redeemed from
all kindreds and nations, the “amens”
from many hearers testified that their
hearts had been touched.</p>

<p>The children’s service in the afternoon
opened with an earnest address, by Prof.
Ellis, upon temperance, followed by Mr.
Y. B. Sims, upon the same subject.</p>

<p>Dr. Roy preached in the morning in
the First Presbyterian Church, and at
night, Pres. DeForest filled the same
pulpit, both to the edification of the
hearers, as we judge from various remarks
of the members. The fame of
the morning sermon came from thirty
miles “out in the country,” and one
good man said of the other preacher,
“he ought to be an evangelist; we want
to get him away from you.” The
prayer-meetings were full of interest.</p>

<p>Pastors and delegates from the fifteen
churches were present. Some spoke of
special religious interest, others of neighborhood
prayer-meetings, one of a pastor’s
class for brother ministers, some of
farms recently purchased to be carried
on by different members for the benefit
of church or school; and various
plans for the uplifting of the people
showed that the pastors of these little
churches are thinking and working, as
one of their own members said, “still
holding on, though there are discouragements.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>Dr. Roy presented the “Past, present
and future work of the A. M. A.” in
an able address, and those who have
long taken part in this work were
thrilled as they heard what had been
done, and realized the magnitude of the
work still before them. Through the
providence of God, the Dark Continent
was to be made light by the labors of
men and women trained in these schools
of the South. We are not only home
missionaries, but, through our pupils,
foreign missionaries. The fact that
Prof. Silsby is the son of a foreign missionary
of Siam, gave additional interest
to his discourse on “The duty of the
churches to foreign missions.”</p>

<p>One interesting feature of the Conference
was the number and variety of the
papers by the students and pastors
trained in the Theological Department
of Talladega College. Though greatly
regretting the unavoidable absence of
Prof. Andrews, who has never before
missed one of these gatherings, all felt
that he was well represented by his
students&mdash;his boys, as they like to call
themselves.</p>

<p>The discussion, “Shall our ministers
encourage the Exodus?” by Rev. P. J.
McEntosh, must not be passed by in silence;
for whatever were the opinions of
the audience as to the propriety of bringing
forward such a question at such a
time, all must have been moved by the
eloquence of the speaker as he rapidly
enumerated the disadvantages of the
colored people of the South.</p>

<p>The third annual meeting of the Woman’s
Missionary Association, conducted
by Miss Adams, of Montgomery, was one
of exceeding interest. Reports from
Selma, Marion, Montgomery, Mobile,
and Talladega told of lively working
societies of the women and girls. The
work was much the same in all.
Mothers’ meetings, Bible readings, visitations
of the sick, sewing-schools for
the girls, all are helps in this work of
lifting up the women of the South. Miss
Hardy’s paper on “The word as a
means of success in our work,” by its
apt quotations and earnest Christian
spirit, touched all hearts. A letter from
Mrs. Ash, of Florence, who was educated
in one of the A. M. A. schools, was received
with much interest, and the manner
in which it treated the question,
“How shall we inspire a spirit of womanhood
in our young women and
girls?” highly commended. The whole
spirit of the meeting showed that this
subject was uppermost in the hearts of
the workers, and that they realized that
the colored women must be helped in
their homes, if we would reach the entire
community.</p>

<p>The Conference, after hearing an account
of the meeting, passed a resolution
expressing great interest in it, and approving
the advance step connecting it
with the new Home Missionary Association.</p>

<p>Time will not allow even a passing
notice of many excellent addresses, but
we must note a capital one on temperance
by Judge Saffold, of Selma, considering
the question in its legal aspect.</p>

<p>Tuesday night we assembled for the
last time, and listened to an eloquent
missionary sermon by Mr. Crawford,
followed by the celebration of the Lord’s
supper, Pres. DeForest and Dr. Roy officiating.
It was a tender, solemn service,
the most precious of the week.
Then came the farewells, and we separated,
feeling thankful for the privileges
we had so much enjoyed.</p>

<p>The meetings were marked by large
attendance, and are spoken of as unusually
interesting.</p>

<p>We must not fail to mention the hospitality
of the people of Selma, particularly
of the Presbyterian Church. They
received us most cordially, attended
many of the exercises, expressing much
interest in what they heard, and greatly
cheered us by their Christian courtesy.

<h4>Young Man with Backbone&mdash;Refreshing
Gathering.</h4>

<h5 class="copy">PROF. GEO. N. ELLIS, TALLADEGA.</h5>

<p>We have just returned from the Fifth
Annual Conference of the Congregational
Churches of Alabama and the first
meeting of the State Sunday-school
Association held at Selma.</p>

<p>This Association was organized only
last year at Montgomery, so this was our
first gathering. We had a glorious,
a soul-stirring time. The Convention
opened Friday evening, March 26th,
with a sermon by President DeForest of
Talladega.</p>

<p>I summarize reports as follows:</p>

<p>Thirteen schools were represented by
delegates, four by written reports, one by
letter; their aggregate shows over thirteen
hundred teachers and scholars in
attendance, seventeen hundred volumes
in libraries, one hundred and eighty dollars
raised, and one hundred conversions.
This does not include the schools taught
by our students through the summer,
although they are really a part of our
work. This brief sentence gives no idea
of the interest with which these reports
were given and received, or of the amusing
or touching incidents connected with
the giving.</p>

<p><i>Mission Schools.</i>&mdash;It will not do to pass
these by unnoticed. It is marvelously
surprising how quickly the love of Christ,
once received into their own hearts, inspires
this people to go out and seek
for others.</p>

<p>We have three such schools about
Talladega. Selma and Mobile report
one each. Childersburg has a county
association.</p>

<p>The superintendent of the mission
school at Selma gave an interesting account
of his experience in organizing
and conducting it. By the way, he is
the young man recently mentioned in
the <i>Advance</i>, who refused a position,
worth $25 per month, in a store, because
whiskey was sold there, which
he might sometimes have to handle. It
takes moral backbone in this country to
stand up for temperance. I learned
something of this young man’s history.
He is making every effort to educate himself
and at the same time partially supports
a widowed mother with her large
family. He will make his mark in the
world; moreover, what he is as to character
is largely due to the faithful efforts
of a patient teacher.</p>

<p>A large number of visitors were present;
among them Rev. Mr. Woodsmall,
Principal of the Baptist School at Selma,
and others, many of whom favored us
with short addresses, which were spirited,
enthusiastic and pointed.</p>

<p>We feel that we may fairly call our first
convention a success in numbers, exercises,
interest and results.</p>

<h5 id="MONTGOMERY">MISS M. J. ADAMS, MONTGOMERY.</h5>

<p>It often seems as if our work grew
upon our hands, so that we have no time
to tell about it; with our nearly 400 pupils,
with all the cases of discipline that
must arise, with interviews with parents
and visits to their homes, in addition to
the full hours of school given to instruction;
then the school prayer-meetings,
the special meetings for Bible study, the
Young Men’s Association of the school&mdash;a
condition of membership of which is a
pledge to abstain from the use of tobacco,&mdash;and
the semi-monthly meeting of the
Woman’s Missionary Society, which we
have of late devoted to “Health-talks.”</p>

<p>At our last meeting I sent an invitation
to the mothers of our pupils to come
to the school-room on Monday at four
o’clock. A large number responded,
and we gave them such instruction
as we could, regarding things they
so much need to know for themselves,
their children, and their homes. The
women listened earnestly, and begged
for another meeting of the kind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>We set apart a portion of the day of
prayer for colleges for appropriate exercises,
and had a solemn meeting.
Since that day, some have been seeking
Jesus. Our hearts are specially cheered
with the evident sincerity of two promising
young men, who, we trust, are now
entering upon the new life.</p>

<p>We have a weekly school prayer-meeting,
and meet on Tuesday nights
such pupils as we think will be specially
helped in a small social meeting.</p>

<p>I must tell you a little about “Aunt
Ann,” a member of my Sunday-school
class, who has just died. She was in
many respects a remarkable woman. Of a
giant frame, of strong practical common
sense, an imperious will, a contentious
and often a bitter spirit, her life full of
tribulation, it was, indeed, a warfare.
She was quite a politician, and very fond
of public speaking, so that she was
known throughout the city, by both the
white and colored people, as “Major
Ann.”</p>

<p>She had learned to read in her old
age, and had a great love for the word
of God. She always had her Bible by
her in her market-stall, and never failed
of being in her place in the class, with
her lesson well learned, and at every Sunday-school
concert or Christmas festival
she must say her “speech.” During
the last of the year I noticed with how
much more of a tender and quiet spirit
she enjoyed the truths of the lesson,
especially those about Heaven. When
visited during her long and painful
sickness, she always called for the reading
of the 5th chapter of Revelation,
adding, “Read it right, for I shall
know if you make one mistake.” That
chapter and the repetition of the twenty-third
Psalm were a sure comfort to
her in her suffering, poverty, and loneliness.</p>

<p>Major Ann’s dying message to me
was, “Meet me in glory; meet me at
the first trump.”</p>

<h3 id="Kentucky">KENTUCKY.</h3>

<h4 id="The_Land_and_the_People">The Land and the People&mdash;The Work at
McKee.</h4>

<h5>REV. E. P. FAIRCHILD, BEREA.</h5>

<p>A stranger passing through many portions
of the mountains of Kentucky
would probably regard it as a waste,
howling wilderness, with no signs of
habitation, save now and then the crow
of a chicken or bark of a dog off in some
hollow. This is owing to a custom the
people have of settling away from the
public roads. Then, too, the highways
often follow a narrow ridge, or deep
valley, where there would be but little
room for building. The indication of
a near residence is a path leading off
from the road, or possibly you may see
a corn-field on a distant hill-side. But
the heavy timber and thick underbrush
generally obstruct the view.</p>

<p>The people, as a class, take but little
pride in good or comfortable houses.
One often has to get quite near before
he can see them, so small are they, and
so much the color of the timber, being
made of logs or poles. A person is regarded
as “having a plenty” when he
owns a good saddle-horse or two, a pistol,
a milch cow, a few shoats, domestic
fowls, and crop enough to last him
through the year. The idea is that man
lives but a short time; he should be satisfied
with enough to eat and wear; that
death, in a sense, destroys his individuality;
that one star doesn’t differ from
another in glory; that “in much wisdom
is much grief,” and “what profit
hath a man of all his labor which
he taketh under the sun?” Be contented
without knowledge, orchards
and vineyards. What reason have we
for improving on the condition of our
parents? Of course, there are exceptions
to those who hold these sentiments;
and if their prophets and priests had
not promulgated these ideas, to keep
them from becoming wise above their
instructors, probably none would have
cherished them; for it would be hard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
to find a people with as little knowledge
and culture, who are so honest,
genial, frank, and ready to receive instruction
as they are. The trouble
is, they have been neglected. The
Southern aristocracy have little sympathy,
and do not know what it is to
reach a helping hand to the needy,
though they are regarded as very hospitable.
The benevolent people of the
North and East are absorbed in aiding
the growing West.</p>

<p>But let us go to the church. There
is no bell to ring, though a bell would
sound beautifully among those hills and
valleys. There is no time-piece but the
sun, and often no church or school-house
to enter; a private house or an
arbor is sufficient, if there is a spring
near by. It is surprising to see the
number that gather when there are so
few signs of habitations. All are very
attentive, and seem anxious to learn,
save a few roughs, who gather at a distance,
provided with whiskey and pistols,
ready to quell any fuss that may
chance to arise. Those who read the
Bible and Almanac at all generally read
them very much, and are ready to quote
Scripture, but are less gifted in its construction
and application; and if they
chance to get hold of any other reading,
they are apt to become very familiar
with it, reading it over several
times. They are not afraid to sing loud,
whether they know the song or not.</p>

<p>It is not one of their principles to
give, unless it be a good meal of bread,
hog-meat and gravy. Many are not able,
and none have been taught, to give.
Some hardly know how to account for
the fact that other people give to them.</p>

<p>The people might be divided into two
classes&mdash;either “in all things too religious,”
or “full of fornication and
drunkenness, with feet swift to shed
blood.” The hills rock-ribbed, the
quiet valleys with moss-covered stones,
clear flowing brooks and running ivy, are
not adapted to engender lukewarmness.
A talented man is apt to be a preacher
or desperado&mdash;sometimes both.</p>

<p>About four or five months ago I made
my first visit to McKee, the county seat
of Jackson Co., Ky. I found a small
village having a court-house, jail, poor-house,
two or three hotels, about the
same number of stores, several dwellings,
and a small school-house, but no church.
It lies in a small basin-shaped hollow,
with high hills on all sides. On public
days, citizens may be seen pouring in
from every valley until the streets are
flooded with people, and some of the
people flooded with whiskey.</p>

<p>On inquiry, I found they had no
Sunday-school, and preaching, perhaps,
only once in two or three months,
when a circuit rider might chance
to be passing. I immediately helped
them to the organization of a Sunday-school,
and made an appointment
to preach there every other Saturday
and Sunday through the winter. I
have met the appointments, and we
now have a Sunday-school with a membership
of over seventy-five, with a good
library and lesson papers. A Temperance
Society has been organized with over
five hundred members. The Saturday
and Sunday meetings are regularly attended,
and the people are now very
anxious that a suitable building should
be erected for school and church purposes.
A subscription of over five hundred
dollars has already been raised by
the citizens of McKee, and as soon as a
thousand dollars can be obtained from
some benevolent source, we shall lay the
foundation for something permanent.

<h3 id="Extract_from_a_Letter_from_Prof_Chase">EXTRACT FROM A LETTER FROM PROF. CHASE.</h3>

<p>Jos. Smith preached this morning a
good plain sermon upon “The Way of
Life.” He had to speak through an
interpreter, but got along nicely. The
congregation was a strange one. Only
two of the women had hats. Most of
them wore turbans made of striped
handkerchiefs, wound around in artistic
styles.</p>

<p>During the services a tithing-man
passed around, a cane in hand, keeping
the children in order, and waking
up those inclined to drowsiness.</p>

<p><i>Avery Station.</i>&mdash;This is rather a pleasant
spot. The river makes three bends
here, and the mission house is so placed,
that from the front veranda we get a
view about half a mile up and down
the stream, of water, rocks and green,
the thick growth of trees, bushes and
vines, most of the way coming down
to the water’s edge, and at some points
dipping into it. The yard is surrounded
by a low well-kept hedge, sprinkled
with little pink blossoms. In front are
cocoa-nut trees, with their clumps of
yellowish green nuts encircling the
trunks about twenty feet from the
ground; an orange tree, a cinnamon tree
with its dark green fragrant leaves, and
several pretty shrubs of various kinds.
Beyond the hedge, on a point sloping
toward the river, is the coffee “farm”
(of three acres) covered with trees about
four feet high, looking very much like
pear trees. In the rear is a clump of
banana trees with a few bunches of
unripe fruit. In the distance is the
mill, whose irregular roof of bamboo is
looked down upon from the veranda.
Nearer by is the chapel, an unpretentious
yellow structure with a school-room
in the basement. The house is
one-story, raised several feet above the
ground, having a wide veranda on
three sides, and containing six comfortable
rooms, besides kitchen, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson is pastor of the church;
Mr. Anthony, from Berea, has charge of
the mill and farm; and Rev. Mr. Jowett,
a native, educated at Sierra Leone,
teaches the school, and acts as interpreter.
In the family are ten little
children who are just beginning to talk
in English, and work about the house
and grounds. The plateful or platefuls
of rice the little things can put away is
astonishing. The smallest one will eat
as much as can be piled on a dining-plate.</p>

<p>[<i>Editorial Note.</i>&mdash;A son of the Mr.
Jowett, referred to in the above letter,
has just landed in this country, on his
way to Fisk University. Believing that
he is to figure in the future history of
missions in Africa, we give a brief
sketch of him, and a glimpse at life in
an African village, prepared by himself.
This will be found in the juvenile department.
Just here we wish to say
that Albert Miller shows his appreciation
of a liberal education and also his
devotion to his divine Master, two things
very hopeful in a missionary. He
found this young man helpful as a
Christian, and useful as an interpreter,
and believing he would make a good
missionary, he has sent him to his Alma
Mater, and authorized the Association
to pay his expenses out of his own small
salary. When such a spirit of self-denial
and thorough consecration characterizes
the church, we shall have no trouble
either in getting or maintaining teachers
and missionaries.</p>

<p>We wish also to say that this is a most
hopeful movement; that of the emancipated
Christian and cultured African,
with a constitution which enables him to
live there, going back with the blessings
of the Gospel to his fatherland; and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
of the native, fully acquainted with the
language of that people, rescued from
paganism, to this country for Christian
education. The meaning of slavery,
under the Divine administration, is
beginning to unfold itself.]</p>

<h3 id="INDIAN_BOYS_AT_HAMPTON">INDIAN BOYS AT HAMPTON.</h3>

<h5>MISS ISABEL B. EUSTIS.</h5>

<p>Mr. Hall’s account in the February
<span class="smcap">Missionary</span> of the departure of his Fort
Berthold boys for Hampton, was a vivid
picture to us who welcomed them here.
We could almost see them bidding a sad
good-bye to their friends, waving their
blankets from the deck of the boat, and
sympathized with their consciousness
that they had “a long way to go, and
a long time to stay, and it would be
hard.”</p>

<p>We wish the friends, who bade them
good-bye that cold October morning,
could see them to-day. If they could
hear their quick and intelligent replies
in the school-room, and watch them at
their trades, we think they would
recognize the record which the new
thoughts and self-control of the year
have left on their faces, and would feel
that they have already gone a long way
and a good one.</p>

<p>Almka (White Wolf), would show them
the blue farm-cart of which he is rather
shyly proud, because he made it, wheels
and all, with his own hands. White
Breast would lay down the doors of a
new wardrobe, he is finishing neatly,
and Karunach would come from mending
shoes, to tell them about Hampton,
till their ideas out-stripped their tongues,
and the old Indian sign-language came
to the rescue. I think E-cor-rup-ta-ha
would stop a minute, with a nonchalant
air, to polish lovingly the big Corliss
engine, before he shook hands even
with them. Laughing Face and Ka-what
would tell them how much they
have made of the new carriage-house,
the Indians are building. Tom Smith
would throw away his plane, and meet
them with a joke and his merry boyish
laugh; and little Ara-hotch-kish would
look up from his painting, with a
quick shy glance of welcome, going
straight to the warmest place they have
saved in their hearts. Most of our
Indians have gained a sufficient command
of English to receive any idea which
can be put in simple words; and if any
reader of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> is troubled
with ennui or thinks of searching for a
new sensation, I advise him to come to
Hampton, and try telling the old children’s
stories to Indians. Even Washington’s
little worn-out hatchet gets
a new sharp edge. Columbus on
his voyage of discovery is followed
with a slightly incredulous but intense
interest, and all the Bible record
reveals again a new force and fire.</p>

<p>Imagine telling the story of David and
Goliath for the first time to a school full
of Indian boys and girls. The room is
breathlessly still. Only kindling eyes
and fixed attention show that the courage
of the shepherd boy for his unequal
contest, his cool disregard of his brother’s
scoffs, his disdain of Saul’s armor
and spear, his dauntless confidence in
God, are meeting, one by one, a hearty
response in the minds of the boys, a
more timid one from the girls. Scarcely
a suppressed Indian grunt or guttural
disturbs the narrative, till the first slung-stone
lodges fairly in the giant’s forehead,
when little Ta-ta-ton-ka-skah on
the back seat forgets all traditions of
Indian stoicism, jumps about a foot in
the air, and claps his hands in an ecstasy
of delight.</p>

<p>The bell rings, and the scholars must
go to their classes, and fight their own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
giants, strong ones, that will by no
means down at the first blow. May God
bless every one, and grant them His
faith, and courage, and patience, till
“little by little” their enemies shall be
driven out.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_of_Items">A CHAPTER OF ITEMS.</h3>

<p><i>Chinese New-Year’s.</i>&mdash;Our Chinese
brethren observed their national New-Year’s
festival very happily, in their
usual Christian way. With great pleasure
do I remember my visit to the very
comfortable head-quarters which our
Oakland brethren have established. It
is a two-story house, very neatly furnished
with whatever is necessary to a
Christian home, except that the male
sex alone is represented there. It bears
witness to the strength of the <i>home impulse</i>
in Chinese hearts, such of them, at
least, as have been touched by the love
of Christ, and shows how soon&mdash;if only
these immigrants were treated as others
are&mdash;Christian homes, in the full sense of
that good word, would spring into existence
among them. When I reached the
house, the rooms were already full of
Chinese, and their teachers and friends.
After greetings were over and refreshments
tasted, several hymns were sung,
and then I spoke to them of the “new
commandment” which our Saviour gave
us, and led them in prayer. Just as I
was leaving, Rev. Dr. McLean, their
pastor, entered with other friends. Before
I had gone far, I met Rev. Mr. Condit,
a Presbyterian missionary among
the Chinese, on his way to the same
place. And thus with greetings and exhortations,
and good counsel and prayer,
the day passed away. At our Central
Mission House and the Bethany Home
in this city, similar exercises were held,
at which the same duty of brotherly
love&mdash;for us “the lesson of the hour”&mdash;was
pressed on their attention, and
made the object of earnest and united
prayer&mdash;prayer to which I, at length,
see the beginning of a glad response.</p>

<p>Of this same festival, as observed at
Sacramento, Mrs. Carrington writes:
“The rooms were very tastefully decorated,
and called forth much praise from
the many who called. The scholars
began the week by holding prayer-meetings;
and during the week, as
friends called, much of the time was
spent in prayer and song. At a union
meeting on Thursday evening, Dr.
Dwinell was present and spoke to them.”
Similar reports come from Stockton,
Santa Barbara, etc. This festival calls,
of course, for a few days of vacation in
the schools, and involves a temporary
diminution in attendance, but, in my
view, the religious uses to which it can
be put, amply compensate for any inconveniences
it may involve.</p>

<p><i>Additions to the Churches.</i>&mdash;Two of
our pupils at Santa Barbara were baptized
and received to the Congregational
Church in that city, at its last
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
communion. Three are expecting to be
baptized and received to the Congregational
Church at Sacramento, and seven
to Bethany Church, San Francisco, at
their April communions. Let me quote
Mrs. Carrington once more: “I cannot
tell you how my heart has sometimes
been thrilled with joy at the faithfulness
of those so recently brought out
from darkness into the marvelous light.
If people all through the land could
know what devoted Christiana many of
them are, they would feel condemned,
as I do, for their own unfaithfulness.”</p>

<p><i>The Barnes School.</i>&mdash;Dea. and Mrs.
Simeon Hackley, who have so long and
so usefully conducted the Barnes Mission
School, have found that other cares,
that cannot be thrown off, make it impossible
for them longer to continue in
the work. Both of them have been engaged
in it steadily for nearly six years.
Dea. H., a graduate of Hamilton College,
having been forced by a disease of
the eyes to suspend study at the Union
Theological Seminary, and thus to give
up his hope of becoming a foreign missionary,
carried into secular life the
missionary spirit. What he hoped for
thus in youth, he found at length in this
work, and to him and his like-minded
wife have many souls been given as
seals of their service here.</p>

<p>It is a real blessing that Mrs. C. A.
Sheldon, who so successfully conducted
the Bethany School for several years,
has been restored to health, and, with
the assistance of her daughter, is able to
fill this vacant place. The school is
growing in size and interest, and, we
may hope, will be as useful in the future
as it has been in the past.</p>

<p><i>Oroville Once More.</i>&mdash;Miss Waterbury,
from Oroville, gives an interesting account
of some “great idol Masonic festival,”
which occupied the last week of
February in the Chinese quarter of that
town. She says: “Crowds of people
have come in from the country for
miles around, dark and rough-looking,
many of them. There were processions,
day after day, in which I recognized
some of our scholars walking.
Some of the forms were tall and fine
as you will ever see. They carried a
huge monster, serpent or dragon of
unearthly hideousness, designed to keep
away the evil spirits. At their temple
there was an unceasing din of cymbals
and gongs, with the firing of
crackers and bombs, and the outlandish
shouts of a mob-like throng; and
nearly opposite, across the narrow street,
stands our humble mission-house, where
on the three Sabbaths previous, Lee
Haim had preached, at eleven o’clock, to
a room-full of his countrymen. On the
Saturday and Sunday evenings of this
festival, the Chinese crowded in so that
we dismissed school, and Lee Haim
preached and sung to them in Chinese.
Every seat and every standing-place
was filled. They wanted to hear. I
am sure some poor, dark minds got a
little Gospel truth for the first time,
and, with some of them, all they will
ever hear until the revelations of the
future world shall be made to their astonished
vision. It was soul-inspiring
to see the earnestness and energy with
which he threw his whole soul into the
work, and even more so, to see all the
eyes, and ears, and mouths open to catch
the new and strange things of which
the preacher spoke. I could not understand
a word, but I was refreshed in
spirit and made stronger by it.” Of
course, this crowd no longer hangs upon
the word. In two or three days, most
of them scattered to their little mining
camps, and the school resumed its comparatively
diminutive proportions. But
God’s word will not return to Him void;
and while we know not which shall
prosper, either this or that, we know
that “he that goeth forth and weepeth,
bearing precious seed, shall <i>doubtless</i> return
again with rejoicing, bringing his
sheaves with him.”

<p>I was born, in 1860, in a little town
called Mocolo. They have no houses
there, but little mud huts covered with
thatch. There are no roads, nor horses,
nor cows. The people walk, or ride in
little canoes on the rivers. Not much
work is done. What little clothing they
wear is made of native cloths. They
have no cradles, and no clothing is
needed for their children. My father
was away in the country to buy rice for
the Mendi Mission, and was taken prisoner
a little before I was born. The
town was destroyed and the inhabitants
killed, but my father’s life was spared.
He was redeemed by Mr. Burton, one of
the missionaries, who paid twenty-five
shillings, English money, for his release.
My father moved to Good Hope when I
was quite young, and I attended school
and studied the English language.</p>

<p>Not far from the school-house there
are groves of limes, pine-apples, plums,
and bacon-fire, and the boys amuse
themselves by battling each other with
limes. The principal holidays are Christmas,
New-Year’s and Good Friday. They
celebrate Christmas by having a big
dance out of doors, lasting all day and
often all night. The music is made by
beating drums, and by women who sing
and clap their hands. The place was
lighted through the night by an immense
fire in the centre. Pots of rice
are cooked, and a sauce made of palm-oil,
rice and fish, is served with it. They
always have rum and gin, which is supplied
them very much more freely than
the Gospel. We have no stoves in our
country. The fires are built either out of
doors or in the corner of the hut. As
there are no chimneys, it is sometimes
very smoky. The natives have no
lamps, but use palm-oil in a dish. For
a wick they wrap a piece of cloth
around a stick. They have no tables,
but sit down around a large mat and eat
their food from wooden bowls, making
one spoon do for the whole family.
On funeral occasions they have a big
dance, which they sometimes keep up
two or three days. All the people
of the village attend, and the nearest
relative is expected to furnish all the
rum he is able to pay for, and a liberal
supply of food, but they have no
religious ceremonies. When a big man
marries, if he has sufficient money, he
keeps up a dance for a week. The
missionaries are welcomed, and are doing
a great deal to break up these old
customs. In 1877, the Rev. Mr. Snelson
and two other Freedmen came to our
mission, and it was under their instruction
that I was urged to give my heart
to the Saviour. When Mr. Snelson
asked me to try and become a Christian,
I told him I couldn’t do it.</p>

<p>He took me to his room and prayed
with me, then he called my father, and
we all knelt down and he prayed again.
He told me to go up to my room and
think over the matter. At first I did
not know what to do; then I fell down
on my knees and prayed; I went to bed
and prayed nearly the whole night.
The next day I went to see Mr. Snelson,
and he spoke to me on the same subject;
I told him I felt greatly relieved
from the burden of sin, and he prayed
with me again that evening. Soon after
I connected myself with the church.
After Mr. Snelson’s return to America,
Rev. Albert Miller, a Freedman from
the Fisk University, was my pastor.</p>

<p>Before leaving Africa I acted as interpreter
for Mr. Miller, translating his
sermons, as he delivered them, into the
Mendi language. My father, who has
been a native preacher for more than
twenty years, is anxious to have missions
planted far into the interior,
where there are supposed to be two million
Mendi people, occupying a country
about 7 degrees north latitude. All he
could do is to give me up to the work.
Among this vast number, there is but
one mission at present, and that is conducted
by Freedmen from America.</p>

<p>After spending three years in this
country, at the Fisk University, it is my
purpose to return to Africa, and assist in
establishing missions in large villages in
the wooded country, far from the coast.
I feel that I need your prayers. I have
been treated very kindly since I left
Africa, and I pray earnestly that I may
not disappoint my friends who have
assisted me in coming to this country,
and who are anxious that I should prepare
myself to be a successful missionary in
my native land.

<p><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span> This Society shall be called “<span class="smcap">The American Missionary Association</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span> The object of this Association shall be to conduct Christian missionary and
educational operations, and diffuse a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in our own and
other countries which are destitute of them, or which present open and urgent fields of
effort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span> Any person of evangelical sentiments,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> who professes faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ, who is not a slaveholder, or in the practice of other immoralities, and who contributes
to the funds, may become a member of the Society; and by the payment of thirty dollars, a
life member; provided that children and others who have not professed their faith may be
constituted life members without the privilege of voting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span> This Society shall meet annually, in the month of September, October or November,
for the election of officers and the transaction of other business, at such time and place
as shall be designated by the Executive Committee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> The annual meeting shall be constituted of the regular officers and members of
the Society at the time of such meeting, and of delegates from churches, local missionary
societies, and other co-operating bodies, each body being entitled to one representative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> The officers of the Society shall be a President, Vice-Presidents, a Recording
Secretary, Corresponding Secretaries, Treasurer, two Auditors, and an Executive Committee
of not less than twelve, of which the Corresponding Secretaries shall be advisory, and the
Treasurer ex-officio, members.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> To the Executive Committee shall belong the collecting and disbursing of
funds; the appointing, counselling, sustaining and dismissing (for just and sufficient reasons)
missionaries and agents; the selection of missionary fields; and, in general, the transaction
of all such business as usually appertains to the executive committees of missionary and
other benevolent societies; the Committee to exercise no ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the
missionaries; and its doings to be subject always to the revision of the annual meeting, which
shall, by a reference mutually chosen, always entertain the complaints of any aggrieved agent
or missionary; and the decision of such reference shall be final.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee shall have authority to till all vacancies occurring among the
officers between the regular annual meetings; to apply, if they see fit, to any State Legislature
for acts of incorporation; to fix the compensation, where any is given, of all officers, agents,
missionaries, or others in the employment of the Society; to make provision, if any, for disabled
missionaries, and for the widows and children of such as are deceased; and to call, in
all parts of the country, at their discretion, special and general conventions of the friends of
missions, with a view to the diffusion of the missionary spirit, and the general and vigorous
promotion of the missionary work.</p>

<p>Five members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for transacting business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VIII.</span> This society, in collecting funds, in appointing officers, agents and missionaries,
and in selecting fields of labor, and conducting the missionary work, will endeavor
particularly to discountenance slavery, by refusing to receive the known fruits of unrequited
labor, or to welcome to its employment those who hold their fellow-beings as slaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IX.</span> Missionary bodies, churches or individuals agreeing to the principles of this
Society, and wishing to appoint and sustain missionaries of their own, shall be entitled to do
so through the agency of the Executive Committee, on terms mutually agreed upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. X.</span> No amendment shall be made to this Constitution without the concurrence of two-thirds
of the members present at a regular annual meeting; nor unless the proposed amendment
has been submitted to a previous meeting, or to the Executive Committee in season to
be published by them (as it shall be their duty to do, if so submitted) in the regular official
notifications of the meeting.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">1</a>
 By evangelical sentiments, we understand, among others, a belief in the guilty and lost condition of all
men without a Saviour; the Supreme Deity, Incarnation and Atoning Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the only Saviour
of the world; the necessity of regeneration by the Holy Spirit, repentance, faith and holy obedience in order
to salvation; the immortality of the soul; and the retributions of the judgment in the eternal punishment of the
wicked, and salvation of the righteous.</p></div>

<h3 id="AIM_AND_WORK">AIM AND WORK.</h3>

<p>To preach the Gospel to the poor. It originated in a sympathy with the almost
friendless slaves. Since Emancipation it has devoted its main efforts to preparing the
<span class="smcap">Freedmen</span> for their duties as citizens and Christians in America and as missionaries in
Africa. As closely related to this, it seeks to benefit the caste-persecuted <span class="smcap">Chinese</span> in
America, and to co-operate with the Government in its humane and Christian policy
towards the <span class="smcap">Indians</span>. It has also a mission in <span class="smcap">Africa</span>.</p>

1880.</h2>

<p>We have been gratified with the constant tokens of the increasing appreciation of
the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> during the past year, and purpose to spare no effort to make its pages
of still greater value to those interested in the work which it records.</p>

<p>Shall we not have a largely increased subscription list for 1880?</p>

<p>A little effort on the part of our friends, when making their own remittances, to
induce their neighbors to unite in forming Clubs, will easily double our list, and thus
widen the influence of our Magazine, and aid in the enlargement of our work.</p>

<p>Under the editorial supervision of Rev. <span class="smcap">C. C. Painter</span>, aided by the steady
contributions of our intelligent Missionaries and teachers in all parts of the field, and
with occasional communications from careful observers and thinkers elsewhere, the
<span class="smcap">American Missionary</span> furnishes a vivid and reliable picture of the work going forward
among the Indians, the Chinamen on the Pacific Coast, and the Freedmen as
citizens in the South and as Missionaries in Africa.</p>

<p>It will be the vehicle of important views on all matters affecting the races among
which it labors, and will give monthly summary of current events relating to their
welfare and progress.</p>

<p>Patriots and Christians interested in the education and Christianizing of these
despised races are asked to read it, and assist in its circulation. Begin with the next
number and the new year. The price is only Fifty Cents per annum.</p>

<p>The Magazine will be sent gratuitously, if preferred, to the persons indicated on
page 158.</p>

<p>Donations and subscriptions should be sent to</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
